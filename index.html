                         <h2>**About KTMMOTORCYCLE'S** </h2>

<p>  The KTM motorcycle company was actually started in 1934.
  The KTM Motorcycle company is best known for their off-road racing bikes and they’ve established a reputation for building fast and agile bikes that are used to win titles.
 KTM deserves a closer look and we’ve discovered 20 interesting facts about them that we thought you’d like to know.
 When you look back through the history of KTM racing, it’s impressive that the very first bike that was released by the company had taken a championship title within just one year of its release.
  In 1954, the KTM took the Austrian 125 national championship.
  This was only the beginning.
  Two years later Egon Dornauer used a KTM to earn a gold medal and its legacy of competition racing was established. KTM would move forward with a focus on the production of racing bikes with their technology geared towards this end.</p>
